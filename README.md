# Graph Analysis

**"graph_analysis.py"** is a program written in Python. In this program, we are creating a graph by defining its nodes and edges. Then using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplot, we can analyse different features of the graph, such as:
* List all the nodes in the graph
* List all the edges in the graph
* List Connected Components of the graph
